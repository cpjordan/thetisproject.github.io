==================
 Obtaining Thetis
==================

Thetis requires installation of `Firedrake
<http://firedrakeproject.org>`_ (available for Ubuntu, Mac, and in
principle other Linux and Linux-like systems) and must be run from
within the Firedrake virtual environment.

Having installed Firedrake, check out the `Thetis
<http://github.com/thetisproject/thetis>`_ repository on Github,
activate your Firedrake virtualenv and install Thetis using `pip`.
